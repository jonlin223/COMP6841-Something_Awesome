# COMP6841-Something_Awesome

This repository contains my Something Awesome project for COMP6841. This project was self directed over the course of a term, where
where I was in charge of the specification and marking criteria of my own work.

This project consists of three sections:
 - A keylogger programmed in Python.
 - Educative blog posts about the security threats posed by keyloggers.
 - Weekly reflective blog posts looking back at how I managed my work process.

## Note
This does not hide the user's email and password and is therefore very much not secure. You can use it by changing the `EMAIL` and `PASSWORD` global fields.
