# COMP6841-Something_Awesome

This repository contains my Something Awesome project for COMP6841. This project was self directed over the course of a term, where
where I was in charge of the specification and marking criteria of my own work.

This project consists of three sections:
 - A keylogger programmed in Python.
 - Educative blog posts about the security threats posed by keyloggers.
 - Weekly reflective blog posts looking back at how I managed my work process.
